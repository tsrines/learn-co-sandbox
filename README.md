Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You've opened the IDE Sandbox, an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code! ðŸŽ‰

*IMPORTANT*
Saving varies by the type of work you are doing:
-- Most of the work youwat you clone into the Sandbox are NOT automatically saved.* In this case, you are responsible for committing and pushing your work to GitHub. 

To learn more about the Sandbox, please visit http://help.learn.co/technical-support/learn-ide-in-browser/ide-in-browser-sandbox
